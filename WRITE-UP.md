> How did you approach the project?

I approached the program with three subprocesses in mind that should communicate with each other via pipes.

> How did you organize the project? Why?

I organized the project obviously in three files, however I did go the extra steps to abstract as much as possible in my code. The reason for this is due to maintaining good code.

> What problems did you encounter?
> 
- Implementing communication via pipes ... '\n' is super important
- Trying to implement logging of driver starting before logging starting

> How did you fix them?

I fixed these issue by iteratively improving the program. 

> What did you learn doing this project?

I learned that you should first have a full and complete understanding before starting anything. 

> If you did not complete some feature of the project, why not?
- Make the driver program log before logging program started. 
- Implement additional error handling
- Implement a seperate menu for history and be able to exit
